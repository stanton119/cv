**(2016 – 2019) Data Scientist, Pythia Sports**  
My work involves the design and application of predictive models within the sports sector. I have experience with machine learning and traditional statistical techniques in both research and production capabilties. My responsibilities include numerical analysis and the full life cycle of the modelling process comprising data collection, feature engineering and model validation through to operation.
