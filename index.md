## Recent Experience
**(2019 – Present) Pythia Sports - Lead Data Scientist**  
I am responsible for a leading a team of data scientists in the design and application of predictive models within the sports sector. I have experience with machine learning and traditional statistical techniques in both research and production capabilties. My responsibilities include numerical analysis and the full life cycle of the modelling process comprising data collection, feature engineering and model validation through to production and operation.  
From a management perspective I am responsible for specifying our modelling roadmap to fit business goals, advising on future project direction and hiring processes, reporting to stakeholders and creating business proposals with external clients on potential partnerships.  
<!--
Making efficient use of resources.
-->
My recent management contributions include:
* Changed team management structure to Agile SCRUM
* Speed up work efficiency by large amounts
* Switching codebase from Matlab to Python
* Started transitioning internal data centre VMs to AWS
* Moved to unittest driven commmits with continuous testing  

<!-- Management experience:
* Scrum master
* Jira/Confluence admin
* Reporting to stakeholders
* Training/onboarding of junior staff -->

**(2016 – 2019) Pythia Sports - Data Scientist**  
Significant projects include:
* Scraping, joining and cleaning multiple large datasets
* Used multivariate outlier detection to speed up database mapping problems
* Moved our dev team to Git version control
* Automated live reporting tools including triggers for statistically significant deviations from expectations
* Made significant improvements to the infrastructure robustness of our production models
* Designed entire model analysis platform for creating, storing and comparing models
* Significant improvements to modelling features
* Changed our underlying production model distributions
* Change the problem definition to allow the move to elasticnet models and large improvements across our metrics
