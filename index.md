## Profile

Senior-level software developer with 20 years industry experience working in Swift, Objective-C, C#, C++, and now Solidity. Creative, independent, motivated team worker with experience managing small teams. Analytical thinker with strong trouble-shooting, problem-solving, and debugging skills and a background in mathematics, logic, and science. Proven record delivering applications with great user experience and a high degree of polish.

Specialties: custom user interfaces, animations, full-stack engineering

## Experience

**(2019 – Present) Lead Data Scientist, Pythia Sports**  
Leading team of data scientists towards business goals.

**(2016 – 2019) Data Scientist, Pythia Sports**  
My work involves the design and application of predictive models within the sports sector. I have experience with machine learning and traditional statistical techniques in both research and production capabilties. My responsibilities include numerical analysis and the full life cycle of the modelling process comprising data collection, feature engineering and model validation through to operation.
